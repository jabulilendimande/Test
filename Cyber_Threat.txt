Major types of threat intelligence 
1) Indicators of compromise 
2) Tool, techniques , procedures
3) Reputation information(destinations or domains)

Endpoint vulnerability Assessment

server profile elements [ listening ports , logged user and acct , service acct , software enviro ] 
Network profile [ session duration , total throughput , ports used , critical asset address space ] 

common vulnerability scoring system
-Base metric group  are constant over time and across context. 
-Temporal metric  may change over time, severity of a vulnerability will change as it is detected and measures to counter it are developed.
-environmental group ( modified, confidentiality , integrity , availability) > are rooted in a specific organizationâ€™s environment


Risk Management Process: 
measuring the impact of threat and cost 
frame , assess ,respond ,monitor.

threat source type :
adversarial
accidental 
structural
environmental

Vulnerability Management Life cycle: 
Discover(assets inventory)
Prioritize assets( categorize assets
Assess(Determine a baseline risk profile to eliminate risks based on asset criticality, vulnerability, threats, and asset classification.)
Report( measure level of business risk)
Remediate
Verify(if threat has been eliminated)


Patch management techniques:
Agent based
Agentless scanning
Passive network monitoring



Cyber Kill Chain ( Mitre ATT&CK )

Reconnaissance (research target) - 
> playbook to detect behavior indicating suspicious activity

Weaponization (use vulnerabilities of assests to build weapon[malware]
Delivery

Exploitation

Installation (install backdoor on target malware)
> HIPS to alert and block installation paths
>endpoint audit , doscover abnormal file creations

Command and Control

Action on Objectives


Diamon Model Overview(Intrusion Analysis)
Adversary - parties responsible for intrusion
Capability - tool used to attack the victim
Infrastructure - network path used to establish and maintain cmd 
Victim - target of the attacker

Timestamp start and stop of an event

Digital Forensics and Incident Analysis and Response
collect(media) , examine(data) , analyse(information) , report(evidence)

Types of evidence:
Best evidence - in its original state 
Corroborating - support assertion derived fron best evidence
Indirect evidence - estblishes the hypothesis
